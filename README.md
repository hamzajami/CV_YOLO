# CV_YOLO
This notebook performs object detection using YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once v5) to identify and label vehicles in a given image. The model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset and uses PyTorch via torch.hub. The result is a processed image with bounding boxes and labels over detected vehicles.
